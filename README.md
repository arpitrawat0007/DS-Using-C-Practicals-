Welcome to my Data Structures in C repository, showcasing my achievements in implementing efficient and scalable data structures using C programming language.

Achievements:

- Arrays: Implemented dynamic array operations, including insertion, deletion, and searching
- Linked Lists: Developed singly and doubly linked lists with insertion, deletion, and traversal operations
- Stacks and Queues: Implemented stack and queue data structures using arrays and linked lists
- Trees: Built binary search trees, AVL trees, and B-trees with insertion, deletion, and traversal operations
- Graphs: Implemented graph representations using adjacency matrices and adjacency lists
- Algorithms: Developed efficient algorithms for sorting, searching, and graph traversal

Key Features:

- Modular Code: Organized code with clear function definitions and documentation
- Test Cases: Included test cases for each data structure to ensure correctness
- Performance Optimization: Implemented optimizations for improved performance and efficiency

Project Structure:

- Arrays: Array implementation and operations
